&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I explain my modus-operendi for creating Solos.
Simply put I created this OS for the same reasons all create OS's. I don't like most of the distro's out
there therefor I can do better than everyone else. OK, while true, I do really say this in a more lighthearted tone.
I just needed something that suited my tastes. Plane and simple. I had roughly FOUR goals in mind.
I wanted it to be Fast. I wanted it to be LIGHTWEIGHT. I wanted it to be beautiful and visually appealing.
Lastly I wanted it to be Feature Rich. You can literally do anything you wish with Solos such as
read books, play nearly all music files, watch nearly all movie files, torrent your friends pics,
browse the web, manage your files, be creative and make/edit photos or videos, and much much more.
I want it all yet keep it fast and lightweight in terms of system usage and space usage.
So I hope you enjoy my work. Please give constructive comments and praise as well.
<br/>Your Solos developer- Maxim

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to thank many people in regards to the creation of Solos. I can't mention
every person's name but I wish to name a few key people. First, thank you Linus Torvalds
for making Linux possible! Second, thank you Richard Stallman for creating the GNU Project
and License from which Linux heavily relies on! Third, THANK YOU to the developers who
create, work on, and maintain all the software packages Solos relies on! You guys and gals are
truly inspiring! Lastly, THANK YOU to YOU the User of Solos! I hope Solos is out of this world
for you as it is for me.
