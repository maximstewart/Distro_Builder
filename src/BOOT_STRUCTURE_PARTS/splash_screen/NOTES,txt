Boot Instructions for the Remix User

To give some boot-time instructions to the user create an isolinux.txt file in image/isolinux, for example:

************************************************************************

This is an Ubuntu Remix Live CD.

For the default live system, enter "live".  To run memtest86+, enter "memtest"

************************************************************************


Splash Screen

A graphic can be displayed at boot time, but it is optional.
The example text above requires a special character along with
the file name of the splash image (splash.rle).
To create that character, do the following use the following command:

printf "\x18" >emptyfile

and then edit the emptyfile with any text editor. Add the file name just next to the
first character and add the text you want to display at boot time beneath it and save the file as "isolinux.txt"

To create the splash.rle file, create an image 480 pixels wide. Convert it to 15 colours,
indexed (perhaps using GIMP) and "Save As" to change the ending to .bmp which converts the
image to a bitmap format.


----    IN GIMP DO THE FOLLOWING    ----
1. Open an image.
2. Scake it to 480 and make sure hight is bound to it.
3. Go to image > mode > indexed (Set minimum number of colors to 15 if you have issues down he road Otherwise leave it as is.)
5. Save As a BMP. When doing so set compatibility options on for 'Do not write color space information'


Then install the "netpbm" and 'syslinux-utils' packages and run

1.  bmptoppm splash.bmp > splash.ppm
2.  ppmtolss16 '#ffffff=7' < splash.ppm > splash.rle
